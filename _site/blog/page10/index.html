    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2009</span>

    <p>You may have heard of (or seen) HONDA’s humanoid robot ASIMO before. ASIMO stands for “<strong>A</strong>dvanced <strong>S</strong>tep in <strong>I</strong>nnovative <strong>Mo</strong>bility” although many would argue that it is in reverence to Isaac Asimov. Currently over 100 units exist, and each costs about 1 million USD.</p>

<p>It has been featured in many different shows, including CES, amongst others. Many believe ASIMO to be a step forward in the progress of true AI. I have read comments on forums and on the videos themselves of people who are alarmed that they would one day take over the world. There are concerned people voicing their thoughts on humans playing god.</p>

<p>All of this has been going on for decades. Some of us look for answers to our creation, wanting to explore the duplication of our processes, and genuinely believing that our mind is composed of algorithms that can be replicated into a machine that can be said to be intelligent. Some of us hate the fact that we are trying to recreate life, and composed others based on our intelligence, stating that it is immoral.</p>

<p>Well, for those of you who are scared about your safety: Robots won’t take over the earth, nor will they turn evil as pictured in the film “I, Robot”. However I do believe the age is coming in which the creations of the imagination and creativity of science fiction authors such as Isaac Asimov’s are turning into real life events. And I do believe that some day it might be possible that they could in turn right their own viruses, spyware, spam the whole internet, conduct highly specialised cracking attacks, amongst other things.</p>

<p>I mean, computer programs can already compile and recompile themselves, as several professional adware programmers have shown in the past. It is only a matter of time before the creation of the <em>spark</em> that will give life to a rational being, one that can act not only for the wellbeing of others, but for it’s own wellbeing. One that can induce creative thoughts, and produce creative output.</p>

<p>That will be an age in which a computer will be able to effectively upload it’s code to the web, allowing expansion over the net, replication in different programming languages, and collaboration of thousands of millions of bots infesting supercomputer clusters.</p>

<p>However, back to earth, back to the 21st century. I found 3 really impressive videos of ASIMO that I would like to share with you. Voice your comments back to me if it causes any interest.</p>

<p>A rundown on ASIMO’s main features:</p>

    <p>Toyota’s robot can speed-walk. OK, maybe this is not related directly to AI but more with Robotics, however AI is required to judge starting, running, where to stop, how to stop, and how to recover balance from a slight push. Hence my reason to post this here.</p>

<p>Integrate this with camera’s, inflared sensors, stereo microphones, speakers, motion detectors, and give it a little spark of memory, a sense of direction, and a wireless internet connection. This could be unstoppable. We’re definitively getting there, slowly, but marching on.</p>

    <span class="post-date">10 Sep 2009</span>

    <p>Language is beautiful. It is one of the easiest methods of communicating something lengthy. As one may know, images express a thousand words, film may even express more, but both are ineffective when it comes to communicating something fast and immediately to someone (unless you have a polaroid of course).</p>

<p>English, particularly, is much more complex than I thought. As you may already know, I am rather _into _AI. One of the fields of AI is Natural Language Processing which involves speech recognition, syntactic and semantic organisation, separating words into parts of speech, language understanding, and finally speech generation, amongst others.</p>

<p>I genuinely used to believe there were only 8 parts of speech in English: Verbs, Adverbs, Nouns, Pronouns, Adjectives, Preopsitions, Conjunctions and Interjections. I stand corrected by Wikipedia. There are about 17 different types if we classify them correctly.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><strong>The open word classes:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Adjectives</li>
  <li>Adverbs</li>
  <li>Interjections</li>
  <li>Nouns</li>
  <li>Verbs (except auxilliary verbs)</li>
</ul>

<p>According to Wikipedia, “an open class (or open word class) is a word class that accepts the addition of new items, through such processes as compounding, derivation, coining, borrowing, etc.”</p>

<p><strong>The closed word classes:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Auxiliary verbs</li>
  <li>Clitics</li>
  <li>Coverbs</li>
  <li>Conjunctions</li>
  <li>Determiners (articles, quantifiers, demonstrative adjectives, and possessive adjectives)</li>
  <li>Particles</li>
  <li>Measure words</li>
  <li>Adpositions (prepositions, postpositions, and circumpositions)</li>
  <li>Preverbs</li>
  <li>Pronouns</li>
  <li>Contractions</li>
  <li>Cardinal numbers</li>
</ul>

<p>According to Wikipedia, “a closed class (or closed word class) is a word class to which no new items can normally be added, and that usually contains a relatively small number of items.”</p>

<p>Now, I was not aware of such classification, but this for sure must have an impact on language parsers. I am currently starting to write my first Language Parser, and thought I would start out with an SQL dictionary structure. I will be posting my findings in this blog as I get along with this.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:4000/the-dream-of-a-i-and-the-elixir-of-life"> The Dream of A.I. and the Elixir of Life </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Sep 2009</span>

    <p>Today I read an article about A.I. on NewScientist called “<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327231.100-noel-sharkey-ai-is-a-dangerous-dream.html?full=true">Why AI is a Dangerous Dream</a>”. I thought the article was partially biased. In my perspective the interviewee, a robotics expert named Noel Sharkey has lost faith in AI which can be confirmed by a statement on the article that reads:</p>

<h6 id="robotics-expert-noel-sharkey-used-to-be-a-believer-in-artificial-intelligence-so-why-does-he-now-think-that-ai-is-a-dangerous-myth-that-could-lead-to-a-dystopian-future-of-unintelligent-unfeeling-robot-carers-and-soldiers">“Robotics expert <strong>Noel Sharkey</strong> used to be a believer in artificial intelligence. So why does he now think that AI is a dangerous myth that could lead to a dystopian future of unintelligent, unfeeling <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/topic/robots">robot</a> carers and soldiers?”</h6>

<p>I have dreamed of AI since childhood, creating flooders, scrollers, and chatter bots. I once developed a complete TCP/IP application using the MSNP8 to log on to the MSN Messenger network with a bot that would simulate intelligent talk. I have always been fond of the Turing Test. I even held a small conversation over email once with John McCarthy. I know this does not make me an expert in AI, however, it does make me an AI enthusiast.</p>

<p>There were two segments of the article that really put me off:</p>

<h6 id="are-machines-capable-of-intelligence-if-we-are-talking-intelligence-in-the-animal-sense-from-the-developments-to-date-i-would-have-to-say-no-for-me-ai-is-a-field-of-outstanding-engineering-achievements-that-helps-us-to-model-living-systems-but-not-replace-them-it-is-the-person-who-designs-the-algorithms-and-programs-the-machine-who-is-intelligent-not-the-machine-itself">“<strong>Are machines capable of intelligence? If we are talking intelligence in the animal sense, from the developments to date, I would have to say no. For me AI is a field of outstanding engineering achievements that helps us to model living systems but not replace them. It is the person who designs the algorithms and programs the machine who is intelligent, not the machine itself.”</strong></h6>

<p>Anything that can be defined as a physical or logical entity or construct can be emulated. Anything that can be emulated could work equally or even be superior to the original. If a machine can emulate the logical processes of the human brain, then it can be said that the machine is intelligent.</p>

<h6 id="are-we-close-to-building-a-machine-that-can-meaningfully-be-described-as-sentient-im-an-empirical-kind-of-guy-and-there-is-just-no-evidence-of-an-artificial-toehold-in-sentience-it-is-often-forgotten-that-the-idea-of-mind-or-brain-as-computational-is-merely-an-assumption-not-a-truth-when-i-point-this-out-to-believers-in-the-computational-theory-of-mind-some-of-their-arguments-are-almost-religious"><strong>“</strong>Are we close to building a machine that can meaningfully be described as sentient? I’m an empirical kind of guy, and there is just no evidence of an <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18624961.700-whatever-happened-to-machines-that-think.html">artificial toehold in sentience</a>. It is often forgotten that the idea of mind or brain as computational is merely an assumption, not a truth. When I point this out to “believers” in the computational theory of mind, some of their arguments are almost religious<em>.</em>”****</h6>

<p>AI is beautiful. It let’s us, as humans, test ourselves to our limit. It allows us to analyze how the human system works, and attempt to imitate our inner construction, our mind. It allows us to try to break the barriers, and build machines that are capable of so much more than us, and so much faster.</p>

<p>I am aware that AI often becomes somewhat of a cult. Sometimes it attracts the same type of people that follow all of Steve Job’s life events, spam online forums and blogs that post articles against the iPhone, and get hard-ons at a keynote. I am aware that AI can be a “believers” dream, but I am also aware that not everyone is like this. Not everyone takes their beliefs to a “religious” level. I am aware that to accomplish goals you have to be down to earth.</p>

<p>For starters there is Strong AI and Weak AI. When you talk about AI, you should generally make a point as to which type of AI you are talking about. AI related to specific tasks, or AI related to the reproduction of general human intelligence. It makes a huge difference to an article about the topic.</p>

<p>I believe in both. The proper coordination of the different Weak AI segments _can _lead to a fully sentient being. And to study one topic, you must be knowledgeable in all surrounding topics.</p>

<p>If the human mind is nothing more than neurons passing on electric signals which can be described as thinking, and thinking is the mechanism that allows us to communicate, and everything we perform in the world is a form of communication, then why shouldn’t a computer be able to be “intelligent”? A computer after all has a heart (PSU), a brain (CPU &amp; HD), a face (LCD), ears (Mic), a mouth (Speakers), eyes (Camera), and can effectively move and communicate through different mechanisms such as robotic limbs, wheels, and other accesories.</p>

<p>Human beings consistently change their thoughts, ideas, knowledge and personality in the same way a computer program could re-compile itself to meet new standards and “personality” as has been described by Matt Knox in <a href="http://philosecurity.org/2009/01/12/interview-with-an-adware-author">this article</a> about his days as an adware author.</p>

<h6 id="ivan-bowmanspends-his-days-as-a-programmer-at-ianywhere-solutions-in-waterloo-ontario-in-much-the-same-way-his-colleagues-do-he-writes-code-exchanges-notes-in-other-developers-offices-attends-meetings-and-hangs-out-in-the-kitchen-over-coffee-about-the-only-thing-he-cant-do-is-drink-the-coffee---or-touch-anything-for-that-matter-its-not-that-bowman-doesnt-have-hands-or-a-mouth-theyre-just-in-halifax-nova-scotia-along-with-the-rest-of-his-body-about-840-miles-1350km-away">“Ivan Bowman spends his days as a programmer at iAnywhere Solutions in Waterloo, Ontario, in much the same way his colleagues do. He writes code, exchanges notes in other developers’ offices, attends meetings and hangs out in the kitchen over coffee. About the only thing he can’t do is drink the coffee - or touch anything, for that matter. It’s not that Bowman doesn’t have hands or a mouth; they’re just in Halifax, Nova Scotia, along with the rest of his body, about 840 miles (1,350km) away.”</h6>

<p>So we have also got that point covered. We can interact hundreds of miles away at an office using a coat rack on wheels as described in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/sep/13/guardianweeklytechnologysection.news">this article</a>.</p>

<p>I am aware that these are not true applications of AI as a whole. But we have strived in different areas, creating artificial limbs that move like an animal’s paw or a human’s leg or arm. We have created programs that can re-compile themselves to allow different circumstances to occur, or to “evolve” as we would say. We have created robots that can detect surfaces and objects and go around them. We have stuck computers on coat racks with webcams, microphones and speakers to be able to “live” in an office from hundreds of miles away. We have created chatter bots that are close to beating the turing tests. We have achieved a lot in speech understanding and generation in the past years.</p>

<p>This leads me to say that even though we have not achieved a <strong>real</strong> strong AI system, we are certainly on the path to producing great results, and who knows, maybe in a few years we will have discovered the pathway that will lead us to develop a remarkable electronic clone of us.</p>

<p>I believe alchemists have ever pursued the dream of living forever. But A.I. has given us the dream of creating intelligent copies of us. I believe that this dream will eventually allow us to download our minds into intelligent beings, technically allowing us to live forever. And while we might have not found the philosophers stone, we will have found the elixir of life.</p>
