    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Mar 2010</span>

    <p>A fearless, cold, impenetrably inhumane character, with a warm heart deep inside, and a tortured psyche.</p>

<p>He figured out a way to escaped his ravaged city. This Robert Johnson, a man I speak about.</p>

<p>People thought he was going crazy, you know, walking out from his house. He left 2 children behind, little ones, one of the 2 years old.</p>

<p>How was his wife going to cope with it?</p>

<p>He barely earned enough to pay for food, and his wife couldn’t work. Disease had distraught her back in 91’.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, Robert left for newfoundland, searching for newfoundglory. He must have walked for weeks or years. Poor Robert, dying of pneumonia on christmas eve, on a faraway doorstep, in the middle of nowhere, where time was timeless and space was spaceless.</p>

    <h3 id="are-you-consistent-with-what-you-do-do-you-finish-everything-you-start-no-i-didnt-think-so-but-if-you-do-congratulations-you-may-skip-this-post">Are you consistent with what you do? Do you finish everything you start? No, I didn’t think so, but if you do… Congratulations! You may skip this post.</h3>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/media/Screenshot1.png" alt="" />Otherwise, I have a story to tell you…</p>

<p>Once upon a time I was just like you. I had many ideas, some of them quite good, and I tried to carry them out only to realise I couldn’t finish all of them. Sometimes I would get bored halfway through and leave the project incomplete. When it was something socially-related and I did not achieve an immediate response, I would leave it incomplete and/or get frustrated with it. Sometimes I simply couldn’t be <em>arsed</em> to continue with it.</p>

<p>What made matters worse was the sense of guilt I would sometimes build up after a week, a month or a few years after starting a project and not having been able to finish it. A sense of being incompetent. And the more things I left that way, the worse I felt. A constant buzz in the back of my brain telling me that I didn’t finish it, and I could have.</p>

<p>One example was Zyborg, a computer game (Clone of ZZT) I started developing around 10 years ago with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/saxxonpike">Saxxonpike</a> in Qbasic 4.5. We abandoned the project a few months after we started, however, I always felt a tingling sensation of having left it just standing there. I still have the code.</p>

<p>I also used to start (and not finish) hundreds of songs, paintings, poems, lyrics, books, ideas, scripts, computer programs, drawings and many other things. I even started a company once, and we were really motivated. But after stumbling a few times into problems, we just silently gave up on it. But the tingling sensation must have lasted ages in all of us. The sense of not having been able to accomplish our goal. The <strong>feeling</strong> of <strong>failing</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="when-and-how-did-things-change-for-me">When and how did things change for me?</h3>

<p>When I started adding a little bit of organisation into my life.</p>

<p>I started off by writing task lists and project ideas down on paper. If I couldn’t get through them in one go I learned not to stress about it and leave it for a later date, whenever I felt more confident or motivated about the project. Then all these ideas and tasks stopped being burdens on my mind and were converted to sentences in a notebook (later replaced by <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a>).</p>

<p>Then I started printing out calendars in Microsoft Publisher, and using them to keep track of future events. I have never liked daily based diaries as I hate the format, I hate carrying too many notebooks, and I hate wasting too many blank pages. But a monthly calendar format suited me, with 30-31 rectangles on a sheet with just the right amount of space to keep track of my main tasks per day.</p>

<p>Further on, seeing the success this brought me in organising my life, I looked for a computer solution for my needs. I needed to be able to view it from any PC where I were at, so Microsoft Outlook was out of the question. I found comfort in <a href="http://calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a> which I have been using for over 2 years now. It was great, I could view it in any style I liked! I started out using the monthly style, however, lately I have preferred using the weekly view as I plan and use it on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Google Calendar, however, wasn’t the solution to my problem in storing my project ideas. One day one of my best friends introduced me to <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com">Remember the Milk</a>. A pot of gold! Accessible from my iPod touch, updateable from anywhere, it was pure glory!</p>

<p>Since then, I have never had a problem <em>remembering</em> what I have done, what I have to do, and what are my plans and ideas for the future.</p>

<p>So if you have ever had one of these problems I have had, give it a try! I mean, it’s free so you have nothing to lose. And if it’s just not your cup of tea, stick around and give the net a look, there must be something ideal for you! The important thing is not giving up on projects or ideas just because you have no time for them at the moment. And if you started one, but haven’t finished it, just keep track of it and leave it for a later date. <strong>Don’t scrap it… Remember it.</strong></p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2010</span>

    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mandyxclear/3461234232/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3504/3461234232_39ee536d22_m.jpg" alt="Computer Problems - By MandyXclear" /></a>A few months ago I put together a new computer. I hadn’t done this in ages so, naturally, I did some mistakes.</p>

<p>My main problem was not using the motherboard <em>spacers</em>. Yeah, I screwed the motherboard right onto the case. This (for those who don’t know much about computers) causes immediate short circuit. Fortunately my motherboard has a short-circuit detector and did not allow me to turn it on.</p>

<p>So I went to a computer repair shop with the PC, asked around for the fault, and immediately a guy pointed out my mistake.</p>

<p>I told him “I knew something was wrong, as I had to press really hard on the PCI/PCIe cards to get them in place, and even so they didn’t fit in well”. To which he replied “When something doesn’t fit in naturally you must be doing something wrong, everything should just fit in.”</p>

<p>So I went back home and put it together in the right way, and it turned on without a problem.</p>

<p>His words, however, stuck with me. They not only worked out for my computer problem, but they apply equally to all aspects of life. If something doesn’t feel right, then you must be doing it wrong.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you eat something that doesn’t taste good, you spit it out or stop eating it.</li>
  <li>If you put your hand too close to the fire you naturally take it away.</li>
  <li>If you buy something you didn’t like you don’t (generally) buy it again.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, then, if we act so naturally about so many of these things, why not apply them to cases such as the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If we are in a job we don’t like, why don’t we leave it?</li>
  <li>If we are in a position we can’t handle, why don’t we say it?</li>
  <li>If we are under a lot of stress, why don’t we deal with it?</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s ALL about communication and action. It’s not about not being able to handle something, it’s about not communicating it to the right person. It’s not about not being comfortable in a job, it’s about doing something about it. Don’t be afraid to live right.</p>

    <p><a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2574/3858394787_de973bda67.jpg"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2574/3858394787_de973bda67_m.jpg" alt="The clouds and Ed" /></a> Yes, in 2045 I’ll be thinking that it was such a short time ago when I made a 100 Euro bet that Strong-AI would exist by that year. I will also be thinking about what I did in all those years, from 2010 to 2045, where did time go? Did I spend it well? It will be a sense of confusion, as I will have done so many things, and at the time many of those things must have felt marvellous, but did I really enjoy the ride? What does it feel to enjoy the ride? Does it feel well in the present, does it still feel good in the future? How do you know if you are enjoying your time? Maybe you know it because you wake up every day feeling good, smiling. Maybe you know it because you wake up with a burning desire to do something new, to invent something revolutionary, to discover to a new place…</p>

<p>I don’t want to start travelling the world when I’m 58. I don’t want to start living at that age, discovering the world, discovering myself. I am alive now, and I’ve got to use the time I’ve got on my hands as if it were gold. That’s why everything I’ve chosen to do I’ve done it then and there, that’s why I’ve started my world travels at the start of my 20’s, that’s why I’ve decided to write, blog, do photography, video, painting and everything I can do right now. What’s the point of starting it all when you’re old? Why not take this moment in time to do everything you can, learn something new, start new travels. It is your time, decide what best to do with it, just don’t waste it.</p>

<p>Once upon a time someone told me that it’s good to develop hobby’s throughout life, because when you get old, hobby’s are the only thing you’ll have left to cheer you up. Life as an old person would be boring if throughout your life you could never give a damn about learning how to ride a bike, swim, do some yoga, play golf, paint, play guitar, learn software programming, graphic design, audio production, hiking, knitting, inventing, arts &amp; crafts, growing plants and vegetables, script writing, reading books, etc.</p>

<p>The more, the merrier. So now you know that it’s never too late to plan ahead, it’s never too late to learn/do something new, it’s never too late to life. After all: Time flies by.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Jan 2010</span>

    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I do not foment alcoholism, but who doesn’t love the taste of a great beer? Well, probably quite a few people. However, I’d like to give my opinion on European, American, Mexican, and other international beers I have tasted. By no means do I plan on giving a rundown on all beers, but maybe in the future I will have the opportunity to taste quite a few of them (while giving my opinion, of course).</p>

<p>I am in no way a beer taster, nor do I know the proper way of doing it, however, I release this list with my own personal opinion about different brands I have tasted around the world so that it may serve as a guide for whoever is interested in searching for different flavours.</p>

<h2 id="canadian-beers">Canadian Beers</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Carling Cold</strong>: I first tasted this one in England. It is a good beer as long as it does not get warm. It tastes specially good when chilled and served with lime juice. (2/5)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="danish-beers">Danish Beers</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3140/2878687804_fffa76f31c_t.jpg"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3140/2878687804_fffa76f31c_t.jpg" alt="" /></a>Carlsberg</strong>: I first tasted this one in England. Stronger and more flavour (in my opinion) than Carling Cold. It has a bit more density and a mediumly rich flavour. Goes down well on a night out, but sometimes I’ve found it a bit too heavy at night. (2/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Carlsberg Special Brew</strong>: I first tasted this one in Scotland. A very strong, powerful beer. Great taste, lacks a tiny bit of body, but compensates with the high percentage of alcohol which gives it a slight tinge of a spirit. I’d say it’s pretty regular on it’s levels of Co2, neither too gassy, nor too loose. I was going to give it a higher mark, however upon tasting it a few more times I have realised it is really not <em>that</em> premium. (3/5)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="italian-beers"><strong>Italian Beers</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Birra Moretti</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Great beer, great taste, great density and a perfect amount of Co2. I do recommend this beer. (3.5/5)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scottish-beers">Scottish Beers</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/61/188334866_814a9da537_t.jpg"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/61/188334866_814a9da537_t.jpg" alt="" /></a>Deuchars IPA</strong>: I first tasted this one in Scotland. I don’t really have much to say about this one, it is a regular beer, good flavour but I think there is not much that distinguishes it as an excellent one. (2/5)</li>
  <li><strong>McEwans:</strong> I first tasted this one in Scotland. Good beer, average. It has a rather nice taste. Co2 seems to be rather optimum in this drink. I’d say it’s somewhat similar to Fosters in taste, but that only my opinion. (2/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Tennents Lager:</strong> I first tasted this one in Scotland. Smooth, light beer. I’d consider the flavour to be even a bit lighter than McEwans or Fosters. (2/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Innis &amp; Gunn:</strong> I first tasted this one in Scotland. This is one hell of a great beer. It has an excellent flavour, and it is the result of a rather interesting process. It is aged in oak barrels which gives it a really special taste. To my likings it was a bit too strong the taste for me, a bit metallic, however I give it a great score for being different. It was presented to me by a friend from Canada who really loves it. I understand why. (3.5/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Caledonian 80:</strong> I first tasted this one in Scotland. Low on Co2, very refreshing. It is an amber coloured “dark” ale. I’d consider it to have a discrete flavour. Other than that, it is rather average. (3/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Special Tartan:</strong> I first tasted this one in Scotland. Not bad at all, I’d say it’s above average, it has a good taste, it can be distinguished from other brands and is very refreshing. (3/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Isle of Arran:</strong> I first tasted this one in Scotland. This is an incredible dark beer. Strong flavour, strong aroma, great density, perfect texture, nice consistency, good amount of Co2. Gosh, I really love this beer. (4.5/5)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="irish-beers">Irish Beers</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Guiness:</strong> I first tasted this one in England. A smooth, rich flavoured dark beer. A bit on the side of a heavy beer. Extremely delicious, with lots of nutrients. It is 4.1% alcohol. The creamy taste of it adds to it’s perfection. (4/5)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="belgian-beers">Belgian Beers</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/11/12539111_0f6689efb4_t.jpg"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/11/12539111_0f6689efb4_t.jpg" alt="" /></a>Stella Artois:</strong> I first tasted this one in England. The “cheap” beer, or “hooligan” beer as it has been denominated multiple times. I still think it has quite a catch, not as good as Fosters or McEwans but just about there. Has a nice taste, smooth-ish. (2/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Trappist:</strong> I first tasted this one in Mexico (Brought from Belgium by a friend). The best beer on this list. By far. I could go on and on about it’s taste and optimum texture, but it’s not worth it. Taste is worth a thousand words. Just be careful with the last bit of remaining beer in the bottle, it is highly concentrated yeast. It finishes it’s fermentation process in the bottle which is why it has such a different and delicious aroma and flavour. (5/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Leffe Blonde:</strong> I first tasted this one in Scotland. Wow, this is a strong-flavoured beer. It tastes a bit fruity. It has a bit of a metallic taste to the mouth. It doesn’t have either too much nor too little Co2. I wasn’t expecting this taste from this beer, I can’t give it a 3/5 because it is personally not my favourite taste, nonetheless it is surely worth a taste! (2/5)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="australian-beers">Australian Beers</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fosters</strong>: I first tasted this one in England. An authentic Australian beer. One of my friends described it as “The beer no Australian would drink, so they export it”. I consider it to be a beer that’s easy on your stomach. Good taste, great volume, but no where near as good as it could be. (2.5/5)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="american-beers">American Beers</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3197/2857338393_a006e8df14_t.jpg"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3197/2857338393_a006e8df14_t.jpg" alt="" /></a>Miller Light</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Watery taste. (1/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Budweiser</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. I love the taste of this beer, by far it is not the best, but I think it has a smooth taste, goes down well, has a distinct flavour and aroma to other beers, and as long as it is served cold it is rather enjoyable. I still prefer many other beers to this one though, but out of the American beers I have tasted, I’d rate this one at the top. (2/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Coors Light</strong>: I first tasted this one in the USA. Tastes like water, worst American beer in my opinion. Was recently given a lot of advertising in Mexico, most Mexicans I know dislike it, though. In America it seems to be quite popular as I’ve seen stockpiles of it in shops such as “Stripes”. (1/5)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="netherlands-beers">Netherlands Beers</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Heineken</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Good strong taste, very different from most other beers I have tried, that’s why I give it a good rating. It has a unique flavour you can easily distinguish from most other beers. It is great when served very cold, otherwise it has a metallic tinge to it. (3.5/5)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mexican-beers">Mexican Beers</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2154/1715718674_475fa0758f_t.jpg"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2154/1715718674_475fa0758f_t.jpg" alt="" /></a>Corona</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. International beer, good quality, quite refreshing however not that powerful. If you are looking for something simple, digestible, with a not-too-strong flavour, this is the one to go with. (1/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Indio</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. It is found more in the north of the country. It has a good taste, however, it is best served chilled. (2/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Tecate</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Best served chilled… Actually, if it’s not served chilled it tastes a bit like piss. It was actually the first beer I tasted in Mexico, and probably in my Life. At first it tasted good as I really couldn’t compare it with anything else… Now I know better. (1/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Victoria</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Best served chilled, otherwise don’t try it. (1/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Pacifico</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Best served chilled, otherwise don’t try it. (1/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Leon</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. I loved it the first times I tried it, it has a dark chocolaty flavour to it. It tastes great when chilled, otherwise it’s not too bad as others. I regard it has a smoothish creamy touch, not as much as a Guiness, but more than other dark Mexican beers such as Fraile and XX Oscura. (3/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Modelo</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Best served chilled. Ugh, some even count this in as an “international” beer, but in reality the flavour can’t be compared with other premium Mexican beers. (1/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Sol Clara</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Best served chilled. Good with lemon and salt, ice-cold, when sitting on the beach. Otherwise it’s not my favourite pick. (1/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Sol Brava</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Great tasting dark-ish beer. (2/5)</li>
  <li><strong>XX Lager</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. This is a great smooth beer when chilled. Good for a night out, goes down easy. (2/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Carta Blanca</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Best served chilled. Dubbed as “The Northern Taste” it is primarily found in the northern states of Nuevo León, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Tamaulipas and Sonora. It has a smoothish taste, not the best beer in my opinion. Tastes rather bad when warm. (1.5/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Regio</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. A bit lacking in some areas, but overall has a good-enough taste for a night out. (3/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Bohemia Clara</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Best served chilled. (3/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Bohemia Oscura</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. A nice dark beer. (3.5/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Casta</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Great solid-tasting beer. (3/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Fraile</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. One of the best beers I’ve tasted in Mexico. As far as I know this one is produced by the Sierra Madre Brewing Company (SMBC) and is found throughout the country in restaurants/breweries of this chain. (4.5/5)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="japanese-beers">Japanese Beers</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Asahi:</strong> I first tasted this one in Scotland. Wow! This is a great smooth clear beer. Serve Chilled. It does taste rather gassy, but I do seriously recommend it. (3.5/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Sapporo</strong>: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Good strong flavour. (3/5)</li>
