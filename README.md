# Lemiffe.com

This is the Jekyll-based repository for lemiffe.com's page + blog archive; after migrating from Wordpress on a hosting provider, then Wordpress on a droplet in DigitalOcean, it seemed rather annoying to have a long-running process that is at the mercy of spikes and crawlers causing downtime due to the VM's low ram (1GB is not enough for a LAMP stack when a traffic spike occurs).
