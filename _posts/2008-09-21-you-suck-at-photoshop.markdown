This is a kind of warped-up strange partially humoristic tutorial for photoshop, I found it quite entertaining. It teaches you quite a lot of functions in photoshop dynamically throughout a set of videos (which can also be found on youtube.com).

In my honest opinion it seems quite crazy, but it's really entertaining, and the guy is an interesting actor... The first few seem rather uncertain although as you reach further into every following chapter, you notice they get much more interesting, much more intense, etc.

The first video of the series can be located at:Â [mydamnchannel](http://www.mydamnchannel.com/Big_Fat_Brain/You_Suck_at_Photoshop__Season_1/YouSuckatPhotoshop1_398.aspx)

I mean, video #14 starts with the following phrase: MY name is donnie and you suck at photoshop... I.. I don't have a lot of time.. right nn... nnow so you're just going to trust me... you're bad.

A wonderful little rabbit hole with an interesting story where you can learn a couple of Photoshop tricks on the journey!
