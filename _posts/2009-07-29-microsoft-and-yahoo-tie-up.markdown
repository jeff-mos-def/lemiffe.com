According to the [BBC Business News](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/8174763.stm), "Yahoo and Microsoft have announced a long-rumoured internet search deal that will help the two companies take on chief rival Google.

Microsoft's search engine will power the Yahoo website and Yahoo will in turn become the advertising sales team for Microsoft's online offering."

I wonder if this will be the key to a revival of Yahoo's profits, and a deeper immersion from Microsoft into Web Technologies, as Microsoft has always struggled with the Web ever since it's release of MSN (Microsoft Network).

Could this be it?
