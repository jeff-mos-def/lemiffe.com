OK, so you are walking down the street, and make a brief stop at an ATM to withdraw some cash. On the way out two cops "withdraw" the money from you... That's injustice.

It did not happen to me, but to a friend of mine, and it infuriates me how this world we live in becomes further more violent every day; no matter the efforts to make things better, society seems to **want **to deteriorate.

In this city I live in, you can't trust in those who supposedly defend you, you can't trust in justice, you can't trust in the law, as all laws are overriden by those who execute its powers.

Let's take a stance. No more [violence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Summit_of_the_Americas), no more [crime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Morelia_Bomb_Attacks), no more envy, no more fighting. Do not empower an [idiocracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy). Let's think **progress**.
