I have been in doubt for a long time about the difference between the United Kingdom, Great Britain and England.

For some strange reason I thought England was a country, Great Britain was the alliance between Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland, and the United Kingdom was the collection of islands including the Isle of Man.

I have done some research and also developed a small image that exemplifies what I have learned.

-   **The United Kingdom** of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a **sovereign state** located off the northwestern coast of continental Europe.
-   **A sovereign state**, commonly simply referred to as a state, is a **political association** with effective internal and external sovereignty over a geographic area and population which is not dependent on, or subject to any other power or state.
-   **Great Britain** is an **island** lying to the northwest of Continental Europe.
-   **England** is a **country** that is part of the United Kingdom.
