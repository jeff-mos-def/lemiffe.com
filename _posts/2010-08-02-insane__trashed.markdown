I think one of the most important lessons you can learn in life is that there isÂ  generally a very fine border between anything that has two sides, sometimes even indistinguishable.

The most typical example is love, there is a fine border between love and hate. But there is also a fine line between war and peace. We can apply this principle to a variety of contrasts, such as sanity-insanity, sober-alcoholic, etc.

Why do I say it is important? Well, it might be the deciding factor that brings you out of an asylum if you ever find yourself in one. Just remember those words, remember that there is a very fine line, and things might change for you.
