Toyota's robot can speed-walk. OK, maybe this is not related directly to AI but more with Robotics, however AI is required to judge starting, running, where to stop, how to stop, and how to recover balance from a slight push. Hence my reason to post this here.

Integrate this with camera's, inflared sensors, stereo microphones, speakers, motion detectors, and give it a little spark of memory, a sense of direction, and a wireless internet connection. This could be unstoppable. We're definitively getting there, slowly, but marching on.
