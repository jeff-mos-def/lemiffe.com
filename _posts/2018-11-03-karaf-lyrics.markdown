## **All the Other Times**

Where are you (4x)

Summer has gone
dreaming on, brother.

Autumn has come,
full of fun.

Dance with the dog,
lie on the floor,
he passes out.

Where are you?
Where are you?
All the other times, we were the sons it was a mystery,
hope it never - hope it never ends.
Where are you?
Where are you?
All the other times, we were the men it was a mystery,
hope it never - hope it never ends.

Had enough of this,
Had enough of this.

(chorus)

## **Floating**

Floating away, again.

Rubber, rubber soles below my feet,
Iâ€™m tired, but running on; I dream.

Faster than all, I dream Iâ€™ll never fall,
Fighting the cold, and dreaming all day long.

And you go and you go and carry on,
and you go and you go and carry on,
and you try to never lose control,
and you try to never lose control.

## **Flying Down the Road**

They say how it creeps,
they say how it breaks down your soul,
but Iâ€™m not stopping - now, no
fools gold and crypto wows,
Waiting for gains,
checking the charts,
every day
pouring my heart
into digital dribble, w000w w00w w000w,
Not to me, not me, not today man,
no no no no no no no.

And when you find out,
that I'm not around,
you're calling me - calling me home,
I'm out and about,
no fears and no doubts,
you're calling me - calling me home.

I flew away that night my dear,
fish and chips are in my mind and my soul,
I neednâ€™t realise I'd go so far,
you never know when your mind's on a roll,
As the night falls (I) set aside my fears,
the way the stars shine remind me of your tears.

(chorus)

## **A Few Drinks**

The land and the farm laid abandoned,
letters flying off the doorstep,
on a breezy day in autumn,
writing notes lest we forget,
empty rooms and broken bottles,
from a man that used to be,
but the burden and the sorrow
were too much, he had to leave.

Hey, whatâ€™s a few drinks,
whatâ€™s a few blinks in space and time,
whatâ€™s a few bottles,
whatâ€™s a few dawns,
whatâ€™s a few thorns inside my head,
and Iâ€™m talking to you,
but you turn away,
and you say youâ€™ll be back again some day,
but, whatâ€™s a few drinks,
whatâ€™s a few things,
whatâ€™s a few blows and blows and blows.

Does anybody see me,
does anybody know me,
sometimes feels Iâ€™ve disconnected from the world.

Does anybody know him,
does anybody care?
sometimes seems a constant state of disrepair.

(chorus)

Iâ€™ll never let you go,
when the bells are singing,
when the bells must toll.

(chorus)

## **Electric Dawn**

Fire,
fire and ashes,
burn our home,
and our dreams and our takeaway meals.

You,
come from a crevice,
tactically,
as we deploy our hotfix.

Gone,
gone are the years,
when we'd program at night,
and we'd listen to rock and we'd drink till we'd drop.

You walk through the door,
an electric storm,
you burst into flames that night,
have you seen - an electric dawn?

Dawn,
dawn,
dawn,
dawn.

Cold,
barely maintainable,
so complex,
can't be optimised, so unrefactorable.

We chase,
never give up,
it's our way,
digging up dirt, building bridges from mud and stone.

You walk through the door,
an electric storm,
you burst into flames that night,
have you seen - an electric dawn?

## **Thousands**

Always at my home,
where am I supposed to go
when I donâ€™t really understand?
Iâ€™d been sinking hell-a low.
This neighbourhood... the floor.

Please get out my brain,
been tryinâ€™ to stay sane
but it wonâ€™t stop; the rain.
And thus I bought a boat.
This keyboardhood. Itâ€™s wrong.

William, how does it go?
I saw you playing piano,
I hope you get the chance,
to play to thousands,
some day. oh.

## **Part of Me**

Part of me wishes Iâ€™d never existed to avoid all the pain and the suffering of death,
part of me is scared, running from people, avoiding the silence and hiding from hell,
part of me hopes - part of me listens - working and sweating and carrying the heft,
part of me ravages burns and destroys, and part of meâ€™s ringing and ringing the BELL!

Tonight it is not all about me,
Itâ€™s all about me,
but itâ€™s not all about me.
The soundâ€™s so deafening!
Go! Go on and leave!

Partially pondering powerful phrases while wondering what is the meaning of life,
but life has no meaning and not that it matters! Weâ€™re already here, and thereâ€™s nothing but vice,
whatever the question, whatever the answer, it better to stay â€¦. and put up a fight,
the pandering, bickering, insult delivering, screaming and punching will not make it right!

(chorus)

I was trying to find love,
I was trying to find myself,
I had patiently given up.
When she came in,
I was blown away,
outside of my comfort zone.

(bridge)

(chorus)

## **Punk Zimmer**

"I wanted nothing more of this!"
I told myself as I walked out,
and as Iâ€™m streaming down the park,
I - saw - plenty-of-folk about,
but everyoneâ€™s on their phones (sign in, sign out),
they look like Instagram drones (follow me, follow me),
and am I losing control? (putting on my headphones)
donâ€™t have to deal with this alone (Iâ€™m singing na na na na),

And as I'm watching Interstellar and Hans Zimmer's epic
saga, tryinâ€™a get to Mexico, Iâ€™m tryinâ€™a get to Tokyo, so long,
Iâ€™m gonna burn this town.

I step outside to get a drink (and everyone is at the gym),
taking selfies, taking tips (with a trail of trolling dicks),
I need to get out of this town (and take a trip to Amsterdam),
But in my head thereâ€™s only shit! (and Britney bitch, and Britney!)

## **Whatâ€™s the plan**

When you go out at night, what do you see? What do you do?
When you go out at night, where do you go? Who do you meet?
When you go out at night, what do you eat? Where do you sleep?
When you go out at night, where are you going? Where are you going?

Danny met at half past eight, a pack of beer, a bottle of wine,
and after guzzling down 5 pints, we hit the streets at nine

Itâ€™s the time of night, the time of night,
itâ€™s the time of night, time to fight.

Oh hello, Iâ€™m in a bit of a pickle,
you see, my friendâ€™s too drunk to walk,
and all the taxis shut their doors.

When you go out at night, can you stand up? Can you get back?
When you go out at night, where are you going? Where are you going?

Danny broke his brotherâ€™s nose, the blood was spilling everywhere,
and as I tried to drag him home, he fell asleep again.
Watch it!

I set him down,
and called my friend,
the night was gone,
and very cold,
and very cold,
and very cold,
and very cold.

Danny woke at half past one, amazed, he couldnâ€™t understand,
why thereâ€™s blood upon his shirt, he fell asleep again.

Itâ€™s the time of night, the time of night,
itâ€™s the time of night, time to fight.

## **The Tide**

The beach is far...

(too lazy to write down the rest of the lyrics, sorry ðŸ˜‚)

## **Dp/Dr**

Home, home at last,
in my head, heaven knows,
I reach, for the curtains,
and I see, plastic people, lost.

So turn the light away,
so turn the light away from me,
I donâ€™t wanna know whatâ€™s next

So turn the light away,
so turn the light away from me,
I donâ€™t wanna die just yet.
