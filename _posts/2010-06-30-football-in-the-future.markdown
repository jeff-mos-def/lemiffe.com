Something about the games played last Saturday led me to believe that in the future there will be no referees, there will only be big monitors, loud speakers, and microphones, placed on the top of a stadium. A knowledgeable team of experts will judge the action live, until these are replaced by automatic systems. Of course, this will only start to happen after a few more world cups, and a dozen more incorrect decisions.
