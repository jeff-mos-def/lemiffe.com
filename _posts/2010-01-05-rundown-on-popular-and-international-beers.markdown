**Disclaimer:** I do not foment alcoholism, but who doesn't love the taste of a great beer? Well, probably quite a few people. However, I'd like to give my opinion on European, American, Mexican, and other international beers I have tasted. By no means do I plan on giving a rundown on all beers, but maybe in the future I will have the opportunity to taste quite a few of them (while giving my opinion, of course).

I am in no way a beer taster, nor do I know the proper way of doing it, however, I release this list with my own personal opinion about different brands I have tasted around the world so that it may serve as a guide for whoever is interested in searching for different flavours.

## Canadian Beers

-   **Carling Cold**: I first tasted this one in England. It is a good beer as long as it does not get warm. It tastes specially good when chilled and served with lime juice. (2/5)

## Danish Beers

-   **[![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3140/2878687804_fffa76f31c_t.jpg)](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3140/2878687804_fffa76f31c_t.jpg)Carlsberg**: I first tasted this one in England. Stronger and more flavour (in my opinion) than Carling Cold. It has a bit more density and a mediumly rich flavour. Goes down well on a night out, but sometimes I've found it a bit too heavy at night. (2/5)
-   **Carlsberg Special Brew**: I first tasted this one in Scotland. A very strong, powerful beer. Great taste, lacks a tiny bit of body, but compensates with the high percentage of alcohol which gives it a slight tinge of a spirit. I'd say it's pretty regular on it's levels of Co2, neither too gassy, nor too loose. I was going to give it a higher mark, however upon tasting it a few more times I have realised it is really not _that_ premium. (3/5)

## **Italian Beers**

-   **Birra Moretti**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Great beer, great taste, great density and a perfect amount of Co2. I do recommend this beer. (3.5/5)

## Scottish Beers

-   **[![](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/61/188334866_814a9da537_t.jpg)](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/61/188334866_814a9da537_t.jpg)Deuchars IPA**: I first tasted this one in Scotland. I don't really have much to say about this one, it is a regular beer, good flavour but I think there is not much that distinguishes it as an excellent one. (2/5)
-   **McEwans:** I first tasted this one in Scotland. Good beer, average. It has a rather nice taste. Co2 seems to be rather optimum in this drink. I'd say it's somewhat similar to Fosters in taste, but that only my opinion. (2/5)
-   **Tennents Lager:** I first tasted this one in Scotland. Smooth, light beer. I'd consider the flavour to be even a bit lighter than McEwans or Fosters. (2/5)
-   **Innis & Gunn:** I first tasted this one in Scotland. This is one hell of a great beer. It has an excellent flavour, and it is the result of a rather interesting process. It is aged in oak barrels which gives it a really special taste. To my likings it was a bit too strong the taste for me, a bit metallic, however I give it a great score for being different. It was presented to me by a friend from Canada who really loves it. I understand why. (3.5/5)
-   **Caledonian 80:** I first tasted this one in Scotland. Low on Co2, very refreshing. It is an amber coloured "dark" ale. I'd consider it to have a discrete flavour. Other than that, it is rather average. (3/5)
-   **Special Tartan:** I first tasted this one in Scotland. Not bad at all, I'd say it's above average, it has a good taste, it can be distinguished from other brands and is very refreshing. (3/5)
-   **Isle of Arran:** I first tasted this one in Scotland. This is an incredible dark beer. Strong flavour, strong aroma, great density, perfect texture, nice consistency, good amount of Co2. Gosh, I really love this beer. (4.5/5)

## Irish Beers

-   **Guiness:** I first tasted this one in England. A smooth, rich flavoured dark beer. A bit on the side of a heavy beer. Extremely delicious, with lots of nutrients. It is 4.1% alcohol. The creamy taste of it adds to it's perfection. (4/5)

## Belgian Beers

-   **[![](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/11/12539111_0f6689efb4_t.jpg)](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/11/12539111_0f6689efb4_t.jpg)Stella Artois:** I first tasted this one in England. The "cheap" beer, or "hooligan" beer as it has been denominated multiple times. I still think it has quite a catch, not as good as Fosters or McEwans but just about there. Has a nice taste, smooth-ish. (2/5)
-   **Trappist:** I first tasted this one in Mexico (Brought from Belgium by a friend). The best beer on this list. By far. I could go on and on about it's taste and optimum texture, but it's not worth it. Taste is worth a thousand words. Just be careful with the last bit of remaining beer in the bottle, it is highly concentrated yeast. It finishes it's fermentation process in the bottle which is why it has such a different and delicious aroma and flavour. (5/5)
-   **Leffe Blonde:** I first tasted this one in Scotland. Wow, this is a strong-flavoured beer. It tastes a bit fruity. It has a bit of a metallic taste to the mouth. It doesn't have either too much nor too little Co2. I wasn't expecting this taste from this beer, I can't give it a 3/5 because it is personally not my favourite taste, nonetheless it is surely worth a taste! (2/5)

## Australian Beers

-   **Fosters**: I first tasted this one in England. An authentic Australian beer. One of my friends described it as "The beer no Australian would drink, so they export it". I consider it to be a beer that's easy on your stomach. Good taste, great volume, but no where near as good as it could be. (2.5/5)

## American Beers

-   **[![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3197/2857338393_a006e8df14_t.jpg)](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3197/2857338393_a006e8df14_t.jpg)Miller Light**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Watery taste. (1/5)
-   **Budweiser**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. I love the taste of this beer, by far it is not the best, but I think it has a smooth taste, goes down well, has a distinct flavour and aroma to other beers, and as long as it is served cold it is rather enjoyable. I still prefer many other beers to this one though, but out of the American beers I have tasted, I'd rate this one at the top. (2/5)
-   **Coors Light**: I first tasted this one in the USA. Tastes like water, worst American beer in my opinion. Was recently given a lot of advertising in Mexico, most Mexicans I know dislike it, though. In America it seems to be quite popular as I've seen stockpiles of it in shops such as "Stripes". (1/5)

## Netherlands Beers

-   **Heineken**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Good strong taste, very different from most other beers I have tried, that's why I give it a good rating. It has a unique flavour you can easily distinguish from most other beers. It is great when served very cold, otherwise it has a metallic tinge to it. (3.5/5)

## Mexican Beers

-   **[![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2154/1715718674_475fa0758f_t.jpg)](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2154/1715718674_475fa0758f_t.jpg)Corona**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. International beer, good quality, quite refreshing however not that powerful. If you are looking for something simple, digestible, with a not-too-strong flavour, this is the one to go with. (1/5)
-   **Indio**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. It is found more in the north of the country. It has a good taste, however, it is best served chilled. (2/5)
-   **Tecate**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Best served chilled... Actually, if it's not served chilled it tastes a bit like piss. It was actually the first beer I tasted in Mexico, and probably in my Life. At first it tasted good as I really couldn't compare it with anything else... Now I know better. (1/5)
-   **Victoria**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Best served chilled, otherwise don't try it. (1/5)
-   **Pacifico**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Best served chilled, otherwise don't try it. (1/5)
-   **Leon**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. I loved it the first times I tried it, it has a dark chocolaty flavour to it. It tastes great when chilled, otherwise it's not too bad as others. I regard it has a smoothish creamy touch, not as much as a Guiness, but more than other dark Mexican beers such as Fraile and XX Oscura. (3/5)
-   **Modelo**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Best served chilled. Ugh, some even count this in as an "international" beer, but in reality the flavour can't be compared with other premium Mexican beers. (1/5)
-   **Sol Clara**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Best served chilled. Good with lemon and salt, ice-cold, when sitting on the beach. Otherwise it's not my favourite pick. (1/5)
-   **Sol Brava**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Great tasting dark-ish beer. (2/5)
-   **XX Lager**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. This is a great smooth beer when chilled. Good for a night out, goes down easy. (2/5)
-   **Carta Blanca**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Best served chilled. Dubbed as "The Northern Taste" it is primarily found in the northern states of Nuevo León, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Tamaulipas and Sonora. It has a smoothish taste, not the best beer in my opinion. Tastes rather bad when warm. (1.5/5)
-   **Regio**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. A bit lacking in some areas, but overall has a good-enough taste for a night out. (3/5)
-   **Bohemia Clara**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Best served chilled. (3/5)
-   **Bohemia Oscura**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. A nice dark beer. (3.5/5)
-   **Casta**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Great solid-tasting beer. (3/5)
-   **Fraile**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. One of the best beers I've tasted in Mexico. As far as I know this one is produced by the Sierra Madre Brewing Company (SMBC) and is found throughout the country in restaurants/breweries of this chain. (4.5/5)

## Japanese Beers

-   **Asahi:** I first tasted this one in Scotland. Wow! This is a great smooth clear beer. Serve Chilled. It does taste rather gassy, but I do seriously recommend it. (3.5/5)
-   **Sapporo**: I first tasted this one in Mexico. Good strong flavour. (3/5)
