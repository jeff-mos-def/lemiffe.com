After three months of work I've finally released** #414749**, my 12th album. The album is a jamboree of genres, albeit not intentionally so. I just let each song take it's style and route based on how it felt, kind of like when writers let the story go on it's way without trying to strictly determine the fate of it's subjects.

The result is a bit strange obviously, I've received a few comments like "wow, this is cool, there's a lot of styles in there", to "wow, there's a bit of distortion in there eh?". Some people dislike the fact that I keep meddling with different genres.

So for my next couple of albums I will attempt to do something a bit more consistent.
