Three days shy of a year ago I published a blog post about my social networks in which I explained a bit about the interconnectivity provided by sites such as Ping.fm which help you keep your status updates synchronised across social networks.

Last year I was on about 10 social networks, this year the number has gone up to 17 (which isÂ  really19 as I excluded Google Reader and Wordpress.com for visual purposes). But it seems to me that interconnectivity has still not matured enough, there is no "home" for your social networks, and I doubt this will change in the short term.
