The walls of your eyelids, painted dreams, colours, textures, moving pictures, except when you return, you see red pulsating structuresâ€¦ in this in-between state, you let go, you dream, you come back, red, what's the difference? where do you dream? what is an image? where's the seam? the border between imagination and what we perceive. If we can dream asleep, can we dream awake? not as in daydreaming, but as in visions, what can I believe? Our mind's a thief, when we let it, in consciousness we bend it, twist it to our needs, but sometimes doubt and questions seep through, and you stand in disbelief, is this real, or are these words and sights not really what they seem? I dream, I live, I dream, I live. I dream.
