title: I moved

Both physically and on the internet.

Physically I went to Ireland for 6 months which was quite an interesting experience. I lived in the beautiful little town of Carrick-on-Shannon, about 2/3 or the way between Dublin and Sligo.

The thing that will stay with me the most was the absolute lack of running infrastructure when leaving any town, the roads are built for cars, not for bikes nor for runners. I'll discuss this soon in a video on YouTube however, as I'd like to dive a bit deeper on the matter of goals, curiosity, and long-term health benefits.

That said, I moved back to Belgium a few months ago, new place, new mindset. It is weird moving from a house to an apartment; you lose the sense of "I can yell at any time and it's all going to be fine" and replace it with "I should probably lower my voice, the neighbors might get mad"; yet at times you are surprised with another fierce sensation of "WILL YOU SHUT UP ALREADY?" as well as the every-so-slightly-infuriating "where is that smell coming from?!?"

On the internet I also moved. After having this blog hosted for nearly 2 decades on Startlogic; they tried to bump the price yet again after being acquired by web.com, in the past few years it went from around 120 USD/year, to 220, and now about 300 after taxes. In a world where you can host static websites for free, it makes no sense. Thus I foray into the world of Jekyll on Github Pages.

That said, this might be short lived and I might just end up posting on Medium instead and using this as an archive of a blog that was untouched for many years.
