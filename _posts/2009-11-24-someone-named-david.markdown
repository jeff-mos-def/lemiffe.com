I went for a stroll through the graveyard the other day. It was a random event, however, enjoyable to a certain extent. I didn't intend to make a photoshoot out of it, however, I found some interesting scenes and moments along the way.

I was thinking about the people who had gone through life and were now buried in the cemetery. What might their lives have been like? How must they have looked? Could there be a trace of history they have left behind? What will their descendants think or know about them? Did they even have offspring at all?

It's interesting when all these questions come to mind as you start formulating all these stories about lives you know nothing certain about, except for their last words. I sometimes wonder about what will my last words be, I would at least hope for them to be somewhat meaningful. Or maybe something completely random would do just as well.
