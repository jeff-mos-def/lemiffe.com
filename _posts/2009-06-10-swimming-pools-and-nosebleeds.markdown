Edit: This post has been removed. I realised via Google Analytics that it was one of my most popular posts, but it was just a personal story and does not give any interesting information that might be suitable if you have frequently nosebleeds when swimming (or the inverse as was my case, where my nosebleeds stopped as I picked up swimming).

A [google search](https://www.google.be/search?q=nosebleeds+swimming&oq=nosebleeds+swimming&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60j0l4.3278j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) might provide better answers.
