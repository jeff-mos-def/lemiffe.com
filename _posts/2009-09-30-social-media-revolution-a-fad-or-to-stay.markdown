I was a bit skeptical of all the attention placed on Social Media when it started booming not long ago. I wasn't sure if it was something that's going to stay, or if it is just a fad that's going to fade. The following video was something I found on [Steve Farnsworth's Digital Marketing Mercenary](http://stevefarnsworth.wordpress.com/) Blog.

[Steve Writes](http://stevefarnsworth.wordpress.com/2009/09/30/is-social-media-a-fad-or-is-it-the-biggest-shift-since-the-industrial-revolution/) "_A challenge for most senior marketing professionals who cut their teeth any time before, say, last year has been to fully grasp the impact of social media on how they perform their job. The new many-to-many communications model forces everyone to re-imagine their tools, role, and strategies._"

On September 23rd The Silicon Valley Brand Forum held an event on the impact of social media on branding. The morning opened with this viral video that uses powerful statistics and visuals to hammer home that this is not your dadâ€™s Internet.

So is Social Media here to stay? Or is it just a fad? What is your take on this?
